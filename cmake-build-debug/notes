1) How to assign random numbers to the edges such that the each edge gets a unique number and the 2 edges in the list
that represent the same edge get the same number?
Ans1: We can generate the edge list in such a way that when an edge(u,v) is added, its corresponding edge(v,u) is added
 right after it and so we assign them the same numbers. We can sort this list as we wish after creation.
